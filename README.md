💡Inspiration💡
“Every gay and lesbian person who has been lucky enough to survive the turmoil of growing up is a survivor. Survivors always have an obligation to those who will face the same challenges.” — Bob Paris.

This Quote says it all and indicates our inspiration to call "Pride" Community to be on equal levels with other people of the entire human race. Our objective: is to create a community platform for all the Pride Community to come together and Live life to the fullest. We want the community to not only enjoy all the basic rights of every human being but also connect with others and live their precious moments of life without any hesitation or fear! This is a shoutout to all fellow members of the community to help us make their Journey more Meaningful, Joyful and Worthwhile.

❓What it does❓
The application is built with 7 key functions:

Auth0 Secure Login Using Twilio Number

Real Time Chat to bring Pride Community Together
LGBTQ+ Rights and Adoption Blogs
Wedding or Birthday or Any Event Exclusive for the Pride Community Hosted by Us
Stories and Testimonials of Our Users (You are not alone)

💭What's next for 💭
Alot has to be done to launch this project in mass scale as we would like to implement new feature like Jobs Search for Pride Community and work upon adding features like Spreading Awareness about LGBTQ+ Rights. We also would like to improve on the UI/UX of the website to make it more user-friendly and appealing to the users.
